Setup: The game is for 2-10 players, ages 7 and over. Every player starts with seven cards, 
and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. 
Next to the pile a space should be designated for a Discard Pile. 
The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!

Game Play: The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer 
(you can also choose the youngest player) and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. 
Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. 
For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either 
a red card or a card with an 8 on it.
You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).

If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they 
might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. 
If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn.
